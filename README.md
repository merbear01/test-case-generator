# test-case-generator
This repository contains the implementation and documentation of my dissertation project, "Automating Test Case Generation for Object-Oriented Testing Using the Hybrid Cuckoo and Simulated Annealing Algorithms." The project integrates metaheuristic algorithms to optimize the test case generation process for object-oriented programming (OOP), enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to develop a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that combines the explorative capabilities of Cuckoo Search (CS) with the exploitative precision of Simulated Annealing (SA). This hybrid approach aims to tackle the challenges of testing OOP software by ensuring comprehensive code coverage and robust fault detection while adhering to the principles of OOP.

Key Features
Hybrid Algorithm Implementation: Uses Cuckoo Search for global exploration and Simulated Annealing for local optimization.
Robust Fitness Function: Custom fitness function designed to evaluate test cases against multiple criteria including code coverage, fault detection, and execution efficiency.
GUI Application: A user-friendly graphical interface that allows both technical and non-technical users to easily generate and manage test cases.
Comprehensive Testing: Includes tests for key OOP features such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib (for numerical operations and visualizations)
